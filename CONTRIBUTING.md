# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Sender-Report.

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

   ```

   ```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and small.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes.
- Keep runtime footprint low (this project targets small VPS setups).
- Update `README.md` and `.env.example` if config or operations change.
- Write clear commit messages.

## Security

- Do not commit secrets.
- Use `.env` for local secrets.
- For security issues, open a private report instead of a public issue.
